# Forget

Delete specific memories from MemB.

## Execution

### Step 1: Parse input

The user provides either:
- A search query: `/memb-forget travel plans`
- A memory ID: `/memb-forget <memory_id>`

If no argument, ask: "What should I forget? Provide a search query or memory ID."

### Step 2: Find memories

**If memory ID provided** (looks like a UUID or hex string):
- Use `memb_memory` tool with `action="search"` and the ID as query, or look it up directly.
- Show: `Found: "<memory content first 120 chars>" (created <date>)`

**If search query provided:**
- Use `memb_memory` tool with `action="search"`, `query=<user's query>`.
- Show numbered list:
  ```
  Found <N> memories matching "<query>":
  1. <content, 120 chars> [<category>] [ID: <short_id>]
  2. ...
  ```

### Step 3: Confirm

Ask: "Delete which memories? Enter numbers (e.g., 1,3,5), 'all', or 'cancel'."

For a single memory ID, ask: "Delete this memory? [y/N]"

**Never delete without confirmation.** This is destructive.

### Step 4: Delete

For each confirmed memory, use `memb_memory` tool with `action="delete"` and the memory ID.

### Step 5: Report

```
Deleted <N> memories.
```

If any deletions failed, report which ones and why.
